    <h2>
      I. THE EDUCATION OF FLUFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      Murchison, who lives next door to me, wants to get rid of a dog, and if
      you know of anyone who wants a dog I wish you would let Murchison know.
      Murchison doesn't need it. He is tired of dogs, anyway. That is just like
      Murchison. 'Way up in an enthusiasm one day and sick of it the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee&mdash;Brownlee lives on the other side of Murchison&mdash;remembers
      when Murchison got the dog. It was the queerest thing, so Murchison says,
      you ever heard of. Here came the express wagon&mdash;Adams' Express
      Company's wagon&mdash;and delivered the dog. The name was all right&mdash;&ldquo;C.
      P. Murchison, Gallatin, Iowa&rdquo;&mdash;and the charges were paid. The charges
      were $2.80, and paid, and the dog had been shipped from New York. Think of
      that! Twelve hundred miles in a box, with a can of condensed milk tied to
      the box and &ldquo;Please feed&rdquo; written on it.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      When Murchison came home to dinner, there was the dog. At first Murchison
      was pleased; then he was surprised; then he was worried. He hadn't ordered
      a dog. The more he thought about it the more he worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could just <i>think</i> who sent it,&rdquo; he said to Brownlee, &ldquo;then I
      would know who sent it; but I can't think. It is evidently a valuable dog.
      I can see that. People don't send cheap, inferior dogs twelve hundred
      miles. But I can't <i>think</i> who sent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What worries me,&rdquo; he said to Brownlee another time, &ldquo;is who sent it. I
      can't <i>imagine</i> who would send me a dog from New York. I know so many
      people, and, like as not, some influential friend of mine has meant to
      make me a nice present, and now he is probably mad because I haven't
      acknowledged it. I'd like to know what he thinks of me about now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It almost worried him sick. Murchison never did care for dogs, but when a
      man is presented with a valuable dog, all the way from New York, with
      $2.80 charges paid, he simply <i>has</i> to admire that dog. So Murchison
      got into the habit of admiring the dog, and so did Mrs. Murchison. From
      what they tell me, it was rather a nice dog in its infancy, for it was
      only a pup then. Infant dogs have a habit of being pups.
    </p>
    <p>
      As near as I could gather from what Murchison and Mrs. Murchison told me,
      it was a little, fluffy, yellow ball, with bright eyes and ever-moving
      tail. It was the kind of a dog that bounces around like a rubber ball, and
      eats the evening newspaper, and rolls down the porch steps with short,
      little squawks of surprise, and lies down on its back with its four legs
      in the air whenever a bigger dog comes near. In color it was something
      like a camel, but a little redder where the hair was long, and its hair
      was like beaver fur&mdash;soft and woolly inside, with a few long hairs
      that were not so soft. It was so little and fluffy that Mrs. Murchison
      called it Fluff. Pretty name for a soft, little dog is Fluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only <i>knew</i> who sent that dog,&rdquo; Murchison used to say to
      Brownlee, &ldquo;I would like to make some return. I'd send him a barrel of my
      best melons, express paid, if it cost me five dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murchison was in the produce business, and he knew all about melons, but
      not so much about dogs. Of course he could tell a dog from a cat, and a
      few things of that sort, but Brownlee was the real dog man. Brownlee had
      two Irish pointers or setters&mdash;I forget which they were; the black
      dogs with the long, floppy ears. I don't know much about dogs myself. I
      hate dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee knows a great deal about dogs. He isn't one of the book-taught
      sort; he knows dogs by instinct. As soon as he sees a dog he can make a
      guess at its breed, and out our way that is a pretty good test, for
      Gallatin dogs are rather cosmopolitan. That is what makes good stock in
      men&mdash;Scotch grandmother and German grandfather on one side and
      English grandmother and Swedish grandfather on the other&mdash;and I don't
      see why the same isn't true of dogs. There are numbers of dogs in Gallatin
      that can trace their ancestry through nearly every breed of dog that ever
      lived, and Brownlee can look at any one of them and immediately guess at
      its formula&mdash;one part Spitz, three parts greyhound, two parts collie,
      and so on. I have heard him guess more kinds of dog than I ever knew
      existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he saw Murchison's dog he guessed it was a pure bred Shepherd
      with a trace of Eskimo. Massett, who thinks he knows as much about dogs as
      Brownlee does, didn't believe it. The moment he saw the pup he said it was
      a pedigree dog, half St. Bernard and half Spitz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee and Massett used to sit on Murchison's steps after supper and
      point out the proofs to each other. They would argue for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Massett,&rdquo; Brownlee would say, &ldquo;but you can't fool <i>me</i>. I
      Look at that nose! If that isn't a Shepherd nose, I'll eat it. And see
      that tail! Did you ever see a tail like that on a Spitz? That is an Eskimo
      tail as sure as I am a foot high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tail fiddlesticks!&rdquo; Massett would reply. &ldquo;You can't tell anything by a
      pup's tail. Look at his ears! <i>There</i> is St. Bernard for you! And see
      his lower jaw. Isn't that Spitz? I'll leave it to Murchison. Isn't that
      lower jaw Spitz, Murchison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then all three would tackle the puppy and open its mouth and feel its jaw,
      and the pup would wriggle and squeak, and back away, opening and shutting
      its mouth to see if its works had been damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Brownlee would say. &ldquo;You wait a year or two and you'll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About three months later the pup was as big as an ordinary full-grown dog,
      and his coat looked like a compromise between a calfskin and one of these
      hairbrush door mats you use to wipe your feet on in muddy weather. He did
      not look like the same pup. He was long limbed and awkward and useless,
      and homely as a shopworn fifty-cent yellow plush manicure set. Murchison
      began to feel that he didn't really need a dog, but Brownlee was as
      enthusiastic as ever. He would go over to Murchison's fairly oozing dog
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what that dog is,&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;That dog is a cross
      between a Great Dane and an English Deerhound. You've got a very valuable
      dog there, Murchison, a very valuable dog. He comes of fine stock on both
      sides, and it is a cross you don't often see. I never saw it, and I've
      seen all kinds of crossed dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Massett would drop in and walk around the dog admiringly for a few
      minutes and absorb his beauties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murchison,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;do you know what that dog is? That dog is a
      pure cross between a Siberian wolfhound and a Newfoundland. You treat that
      dog right and you'll have a fortune in him. Why, a pure Siberian wolfhound
      is worth a thousand dollars, and a good&mdash;a really good Newfoundland,
      mind you&mdash;is worth two thousand, and you've got both in one dog.
      That's three thousand dollars' worth of dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the next six months Fluff grew. He broadened out and lengthened and
      heightened, and every day or two Brownlee or Massett would discover a new
      strain of dog in him. They pointed out to Murchison all the marks by which
      he could tell the different kinds of dog that were combined in Fluff, and
      every time they discovered a new one they held a sort of jubilee, and
      bragged and swelled their chests. They seemed to spend all their time
      thinking up odd and strange kinds of dog that Fluff had in him. Brownlee
      discovered the traces of Cuban bloodhound, Kamtchatka hound, beagle,
      Brague de Bengale, and Thibet mastiff, but Massett first traced the
      stag-hound, Turkoman watchdog, Dachshund, and Harrier in him.

      <img src="images/26.jpg" alt="26" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Murchison, not being a doggish man, never claimed to have noticed any of
      these family resemblances, and never said what he thought the dog really
      was until a month or two later, when he gave it as his opinion that the
      dog was a cross between a wolf, a Shetland pony, and hyena. It was about
      that time that Fluff had to be chained. He had begun to eat other dogs,
      and children and chickens. The first night Murchison chained him to his
      kennel Fluff walked half a mile, taking the kennel along, and then only
      stopped because the kennel got tangled with a lamp-post. The man who
      brought him home claimed that Fluff was nearly asphyxiated when he found
      him; said he gnawed half through the lamp-post, and that gas got in his
      lungs, but this was not true. Murchison learned afterwards that it was
      only a gasoline lamp-post, and a wooden one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were only some stags around this part of the country,&rdquo; said
      Massett, &ldquo;the stag-hound strain in that dog would be mighty valuable. You
      could rent him out to everybody who wanted to go stag hunting; and you'd
      have a regular monopoly, because he's the only staghound in this part of
      the country. And stag hunting would be popular, too, out here, because
      there are no game laws that interfere with stag hunting in this State.
      There is no closed season. People could hunt stags all the year round, and
      you'd have that dog busy every day of the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; sneered Brownlee, &ldquo;only there are no stags. And he hasn't any
      staghound blood in him. Pity there are no Dachs in this State, too, isn't
      it? Then Murchison could hire his dog at night, too. They hunt Dachs at
      night, don't they, Massett? Only there is no Dachshund blood in him,
      either. If there was, and if there were a few Dachs-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Massett was mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And you, with your Cuban bloodhound strain! I suppose if
      it was the open season for Cubans, you'd go out with the dog and tree a
      few! Or put on snowshoes and follow the Kamtchat to his icy lair!&rdquo;
       Brownlee doesn't get mad easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murchison,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;leaving out Mas-sett's dreary nonsense about
      staghounds, I can tell you that dog would make the finest duck dog in the
      State. He's got all the points for a good duck dog, and I ought to know
      for I have two of the best duck dogs that ever lived. All he needs is
      training. If you will train him right you'll have a mighty valuable dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't hunt ducks,&rdquo; said Murchison, &ldquo;and I don't know how to train
      even a lap-dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let me attend to his education,&rdquo; said Brownlee. &ldquo;I just want to show
      Massett here that I know a dog when I see one. I'll show Massett the
      finest duck dog he ever saw when I get through with Fluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he went over and got his shotgun, just to give Fluff his first lesson.
      The first thing a duck dog must learn is not to be afraid of a gun, and
      Brownlee said that if a dog first learned about guns right at his home he
      was not so apt to be afraid of them. He said that if a dog heard a gun for
      the first time when he was away from home and in strange surroundings he
      was quite right to be surprised and startled, but if he heard it in the
      bosom of his family, with all his friends calmly seated about, he would
      think it was a natural thing, and accept it as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Brownlee put a shell in his gun and Mas-sett and Murchison sat on the
      porch steps and pretended to be uninterested and normal, and Brownlee
      stood up and aimed the gun in the air. Fluff was eating a bone, but
      Brownlee spoke to him and he looked up, and Brownlee pulled the trigger.
      It seemed about five minutes before Fluff struck the ground, he jumped so
      high when the gun was fired, and then he started north by northeast at
      about sixty miles an hour. He came back all right, three weeks later, but
      his tail was still between his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/32.jpg" alt="32" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Brownlee didn't feel the least discouraged. He said he saw now that the
      whole principle of what he had done was wrong; that no dog with any brains
      whatever could be anything but frightened to hear a gun shot off right in
      the bosom of his family. That was no place to fire a gun. He said Fluff
      evidently thought the whole lot of us were crazy, and ran in fear of his
      life, thinking we were insane and might shoot him next. He said the thing
      to do was to take the shotgun into its natural surroundings and let Fluff
      learn to love it there. He pictured Fluff enjoying the sound of the gun
      when he heard it at the edge of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murchison never hunted ducks, but as Fluff was his dog, he went with
      Brownlee, and of course Massett went. Massett wanted to see the failure.
      He said he wished stags were as plentiful as ducks, and he would show
      Brownlee!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluff was a strong dog&mdash;he seemed to have a strain of ox in him, so
      far as strength went&mdash;and as long as he saw the gun he insisted that
      he would stay at home; but when Brownlee wrapped the gun in brown paper so
      it looked like a big parcel from the meat shop, the horse that they had
      hitched to the buck-board was able to drag Fluff along without straining
      itself. Fluff was fastened to the rear axle with a chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached Duck Lake, Brownlee untied Fluff and patted him, and
      then unwrapped the gun. Fluff gave one pained glance and made the six-mile
      run home in seven minutes without stopping. He was home before Brownlee
      could think of anything to say, and he went so far into his kennel that
      Murchison had to take off the boards at the back to find him that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing,&rdquo; was what Brownlee said when he did speak; &ldquo;young dogs
      are often that way. Gun fright. They have to be gun broken. You come out
      to-morrow, and I'll show you how a man who really knows how to handle a
      dog does the trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day, when Fluff saw the buck-board he went into his kennel, and
      they couldn't pry him out with the hoe-handle. He connected buckboards and
      guns in his mind, so Brownlee borrowed the butcher's delivery wagon, and
      they drove to Wild Lake. It was seven miles, but Fluff seemed more willing
      to go in that direction than toward Duck Lake. He did not seem to care to
      go to Duck Lake at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said Brownlee, &ldquo;I'll show you the intelligent way to handle a
      dog. I'll prove to him that he has nothing to fear, that I am his comrade
      and friend. And at the same time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'll not have him running off
      home and spoiling our day's sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he took the chain and fastened it around his waist, and then he sat
      down and talked to Fluff like an old friend, and got him in a playful
      mood. Then he had Murchison get the gun out of the wagon and lay it on the
      ground about twenty feet off. It was wrapped in brown paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee talked to Fluff and told him what fine sport duck hunting is, and
      then, as if by chance, he got on his hands and knees and crawled toward
      the gun. Fluff hung back a little, but the chain just coaxed him a little,
      too, and they edged up to the gun, and Brownlee pretended to discover it
      unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fluff nosed up to it and sniffed it, and then went at it as if it was
      Massett's cat. That Brownlee had wrapped a beefsteak around the gun,
      inside the paper, and Fluff tore off the paper and ate the steak, and
      Brownlee winked at Murchison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if here isn't a gun! Look at this, Fluff&mdash;a
      gun! Gosh! but we are in luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Would you believe it, that dog sniffed at the gun, and did not fear it in
      the least? You could have hit him on the head with it and he would not
      have minded it. He never did mind being hit with small things like guns
      and ax handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee got up and stood erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; he said proudly. &ldquo;All a man needs with a dog like this is
      intelligence. A dog is like a horse. He wants his reason appealed to. Now,
      if I fire the gun, he may be a little startled, but I have created a faith
      in me in him. He knows there is nothing dangerous in a gun <i>as</i> a
      gun. He knows I am not afraid of it, so he is not afraid. He realizes that
      we are chained together, and that proves to him that he need not run
      unless I run. Now watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee fired the shotgun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he started for home. He did not start lazily, like a boy
      starting to the wood pile, but went promptly and with a dash. His first
      jump was only ten feet, and we heard him grunt as he landed, but after
      that he got into his stride and made fourteen feet each jump. He was bent
      forward a good deal in the middle, where the chain was, and in many ways
      he was not as graceful as a professional cinder-path track runner, but, in
      running, the main thing is to cover the ground rapidly. Brownlee did that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massett said it was a bad start. He said it was all right to start a
      hundred-yard dash that way, but for a long-distance run&mdash;a run of
      seven miles across country&mdash;the start was too impetuous; that it
      showed a lack of generalship, and that when it came to the finish the
      affair would be tame; but it wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee said afterwards that there wasn't a tame moment in the entire
      seven miles. It was rather more wild than tame. He felt right from the
      start that the finish would be sensational, unless the chain cut him quite
      in two, and it didn't. He said that when the chain had cut as far as his
      spinal column it could go no farther, and it stopped and clung there, but
      it was the only thing that did stop, except his breath. It was several
      years later that I first met Brownlee, and he was still breathing hard,
      like a man who has just been running rapidly. Brownlee says when he shuts
      his eyes his legs still seem to be going.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first mile was through underbrush, and that was lucky, for the
      underbrush removed most of Brownlee's clothing, and put him in better
      running weight, but at the mile and a quarter they struck the road. He
      said at two miles he thought he might be overexercising the dog and maybe
      he had better stop, but the dog seemed anxious to get home so he didn't
      stop there. He said that at three miles he was sure the dog was overdoing,
      and that with his knowledge of dogs he was perfectly able to stop a
      running dog in its own length if he could speak to it, but he couldn't
      speak to this dog for two reasons. One was that he couldn't overtake the
      dog and the other was that all the speak was yanked out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached five miles the dog seemed to think they were taking too
      much time to get home, and let out a few more laps of speed, and it was
      right there that Brownlee decided that Fluff had some greyhound blood in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that when they reached town he felt as if he would have been glad
      to stop at his own house and lie down for awhile, but the dog didn't want
      to, and so they went on; but that he ought to be thankful that the dog was
      willing to stop at that town at all. The next town was twelve miles
      farther on, and the roads were bad. But the dog turned into Murchison's
      yard and went right into his kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Murchison and Massett got home, an hour or so later, after driving
      the horse all the way at a gallop, they found old Gregg, the carpenter,
      prying the roof off the kennel. You see, Murchison had knocked the rear
      out of the kennel the day before, and so when the dog aimed for the front
      he went straight through, and as Brownlee was built more perpendicular
      than the dog, Brownlee didn't go quite through. He went in something like
      doubling up a dollar bill to put it into a thimble. I don't suppose anyone
      would want to double up a dollar bill to put it into a thimble, but
      neither did Brownlee want to be doubled up and put into the kennel. It was
      the dog's thought. So they had to take the kennel roof off.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got Brownlee out they laid him on the grass, and covered him up
      with a porch rug, and let him lie there a couple of hours to pant, for
      that seemed what he wanted to do just then. It was the longest period
      Brownlee ever spent awake without talking about dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murchison and Massett and old Gregg and twenty-six informal guests stood
      around and gazed at Brownlee panting. Presently Brownlee was able to gasp
      out a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murchison,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;Murchison, if you just had that dog in Florence&mdash;or
      wherever it is they race dogs&mdash;you'd have a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He panted awhile, and then gasped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a great runner; a phenomenal runner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had to pant more, and then he gasped with pride:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wasn't three feet behind him all the way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <h2>
      II. GETTING RID OF FLUFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      So after that Murchison decided to get rid of Fluff. He told me that he
      had never really-wanted a dog, anyway, but that when a dog is sent, all
      the way from New York, anonymously, with $2.80 charges paid, it is hard to
      cast the dog out into the cold world without giving it a trial. So
      Murchison tried the dog for a few more years, and at last he decided he
      would have to get rid of him. He came over and spoke to me about it,
      because I had just moved in next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like dogs?&rdquo; he asked, and that was the first word of conversation
      I ever had with Murchison. I told him frankly that I did not like dogs,
      and that my wife did not like them, and Murchison seemed more pleased than
      if I had offered him a thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I am glad of that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for Mrs. Murchison and I hate dogs. If
      you do not like dogs, I will get rid of Fluff. I made up my mind several
      years ago to get rid of Fluff, but when I heard you were going to move
      into this house, I decided not to get rid of him until I knew whether you
      liked dogs or not. I told Mrs. Murchison that if we got rid of Fluff
      before you came, and then found that you loved dogs and owned one, you
      might take our getting rid of Fluff as a hint that your dog was
      distasteful to us, and it might hurt your feelings. And Mrs. Murchison
      said that if you had a dog, your dog might feel lonely in a strange place
      and might like to have Fluff to play with until your dog got used to the
      neighborhood. So we did not get rid of him; but if you do not like dogs we
      will get rid of him right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told Murchison that I saw he was the kind of a neighbor a man liked to
      have, and that it was kind of him to offer to get rid of Fluff, but that
      he mustn't do so just on our account.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that if he wanted to keep the dog, he had better do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that is kind of you,&rdquo; said Murchison, &ldquo;but we would really rather
      get rid of him. I decided several years ago that I would get rid of him,
      but Brownlee likes dogs, and took an interest in Fluff, and wanted to make
      a bird dog of him, so we kept Fluff for his sake. But now Brownlee is
      tired of making a bird dog of him. He says Fluff is too strong to make a
      good bird dog, and not strong enough to rent out as a horse, and he is
      willing I should get rid of him. He says he is anxious for me to get rid
      of him as soon as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I saw Fluff I agreed with Brownlee. At the first glance I saw that
      Fluff was a failure as a dog, and that to make a good camel he needed a
      shorter neck and more hump, but he had the general appearance of an
      amateur camel. He looked as if some one who had never seen a dog, but had
      heard of one, had started out to make a dog, and got to thinking of a
      camel every once in a while, and had tried to show me Fluff that day
      worked in parts of what he thought a camel was like with what he thought a
      dog was like, and then&mdash;when the job was about done&mdash;had decided
      it was a failure, and had just finished it up any way, sticking on the
      meanest and cheapest hair he could find, and getting most of it on wrong
      side to.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cheap hair did not matter much. Murchison and Brownlee showed me
      the place where Fluff had worn most of it off the ridge pole of his back
      crawling under the porch. He tried to show me Fluff that day, but it was
      so dark under the porch that I could not tell which was Fluff and which
      was simply underneathness of porch. But from what Brownlee told me that
      day, I knew that Fluff had suffered a permanent dislocation of the
      spirits. He told me he had taken Fluff out to make a duck dog of him, and
      that all the duck Fluff was interested in was to duck when he saw a gun,
      and that after he had heard a gun fired once or twice he had become sad
      and dejected, and had acquired a permanently ingrowing tail, and an
      expression of face like a coyote, but more mournful. He had acquired a
      habit of carrying his head down and forward, as if he was about to lay it
      on the headsman's block, and knew he deserved that and more, and the
      sooner it was over the better. He couldn't even scratch fleas correctly.
      Brownlee said that when he met a flea in the road he would not even go
      around it, but would stoop down like a camel to let the flea get aboard.
      He was that kind of a dog. He was the most discouraged dog I ever knew.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/46.jpg" alt="46" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The next day I was putting down the carpet in the back bedroom, when in
      came Murchison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came over to speak to you about Fluff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am afraid he must
      have annoyed you last night. I suppose you heard him howl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Murchison,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I did hear him. I never knew a dog could howl
      so loud and long as that. He must have been very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Murchison cheerfully. &ldquo;That is the way he always howls.
      That is one of the reasons I have decided to get rid of Fluff. But it is a
      great deal worse for us than it is for you. The air inlet of our furnace
      is at the side of the house just where Fluff puts his head when he howls,
      and the register in our room is right at the head of our bed. So his howl
      goes in at the inlet and down through the furnace and up the furnace
      pipes, and is delivered right in our room, just as clear and strong as if
      he was in the room. That is one reason I have fully decided to get rid of
      Fluff. It would not be so bad if we had only one register in our house,
      but we have ten, and when Fluff howls, his voice is delivered by all ten
      registers, so it is just as if we had ten Fluffs in the house at one time.
      And ten howls like Fluff's are too much. Even Brownlee says so.&rdquo; I told
      Murchison that I agreed with Brownlee perfectly. Fluff had a bad howl. It
      sounded as if Cruel Fate, with spikes in his shoes, had stepped on Fluff's
      inmost soul, and then jogged up and down on the tenderest spot, and Fluff
      was trying to reproduce his feelings in vocal exercises. It sounded like a
      cheap phonograph giving a symphony in the key of woe minor, with a
      megaphone attachment and bad places in the record. Judging by his voice,
      the machine needed a new needle. But the megaphone attachment was all
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee&mdash;who knows all about dogs&mdash;said that he knew what was
      the matter with Fluff. He said Fluff had a very high-grade musical
      temperament, and that he longed to be the Caruso of dogs. He said that he
      could see that all through his bright and hopeful puppyhood he had looked
      forward to being a great singer, with a Wagner repertoire and tremolo
      stops in his song organ, and that he had early set his aim at perfection.
      He said Fluff was that kind of a dog, and that when he saw what his voice
      had turned out to be he was dissatisfied, and became morbid. He said that
      any dog that had a voice like Fluff's had a right to be dissatisfied with
      it&mdash;he would be dissatisfied himself with that voice. He said he did
      not wonder that Fluff slunk around all day, feeling he was no good on
      earth, and that he could understand that when night came and everything
      was still, so that Fluff could judge of the purity of his tonal quality
      better, he would pull out his voice, and tune it up and look it over and
      try it again, hoping it had improved since he tried it last. Brownlee said
      it never had improved, and that was what made Fluff's howl so mournful&mdash;it
      was full of tears. He said Fluff would go to G flat and B flat and D flat,
      and so on until he struck a note he felt he was pretty good at, and then
      he would cling to that note and weep it full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/52.jpg" alt="52" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      He asked Murchison if he hadn't noticed that the howl was sort of damp and
      salty from the tears, but Murchison said he hadn't noticed the dampness.
      He said it probably got dried out of the howl before it readied him,
      coming through the furnace. Then Brownlee said that if there was only some
      way of regulating Fluff, so that he could be turned on and off, Murchison
      would have a fortune in him: he could turn his howl off when people wanted
      to be cheerful, and then, when a time of great national woe occurred,
      Murchison could turn Fluff on and set him going. He said he never heard
      anything in his life that came so near expressing in sound a great
      national woe as Fluff's howl did. He said Fluff might lack finish in tonal
      quality, but that in woe quality he was a master: he was stuffed so full
      of woe quality that it oozed out of his pores. He said he always thought
      what a pity it was for dogs like Fluff that people preferred cheerful
      songs like &ldquo;Annie Rooney&rdquo; and &ldquo;Waltz me around again, Willie&rdquo; to the
      nobler woe operas. He said he had tried to like good music himself, but it
      was no use: whenever he heard Fluff sing, he felt that Murchison ought to
      get rid of Fluff. Then Murchison said that was just what he was going to
      do. What he wanted to talk about was how to get rid of Fluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am getting too far ahead of my story. Whenever I get to talking
      about the howl of Fluff, I find I wander on for hours at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes hours of talk to explain just what a mean howl Fluff had.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as I was saying, Murchison came over while I was putting down the
      carpet in my back bedroom, and told me he had fully decided to get rid of
      Fluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fully decided to get rid of him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the only thing
      that bothers me is how to get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him away,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good idea!&rdquo; said Murchison gratefully. &ldquo;That's the very idea
      that occurred to me when I first thought of getting rid of Fluff. It is an
      idea that just matches Fluff all over. That is just the kind of dog Fluff
      is. If ever a dog was made to give away, Fluff was made for it. The more I
      think about him and look at him and study him, the surer I am that the
      only thing he is good for is to give away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he shook his head and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only trouble,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that Fluff <i>is</i> the give-away kind
      of dog. That is the only kind you can't give away. There is only one time
      of the year that a person can make presents of things that are good for
      nothing but to give away, and that is at Christmas. Now, I might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murchison,&rdquo; I said, laying my tack hammer on the floor and standing up,
      &ldquo;you don't mean to keep that infernal, howling beast until Christmas, do
      you? If you do, I shall stop putting down this carpet. I shall pull out
      the tacks that are already in and move elsewhere. Why, this is only the
      first of May, and if I have to sleep&mdash;if I have to keep awake every
      night and listen to that animated foghorn drag his raw soul over the teeth
      of a rusty harrow&mdash;I shall go crazy. Can't you think of some one that
      is going to have a birthday sooner than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; said Murchison wistfully, &ldquo;but I can't. I want to get
      rid of Fluff, and so does Brownlee, and so does Massett, but I can't think
      of a way to get rid of him, and neither can they.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murchison,&rdquo; I said, with some asperity, for I hate a man who trifles, &ldquo;if
      I really thought you and Brownlee and Massett were as stupid as all that,
      I would be sorry I moved into this neighborhood, but I don't believe it. I
      believe you do not mean to get rid of Fluff. I believe you and Brownlee
      and Massett want to keep him. If you wanted to get rid of him, you could
      do it the same way you got him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an excellent idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Murchison. &ldquo;That is one of the best
      ideas I ever heard, and I would go and do it if I hadn't done it so often
      already. As soon as Brownlee suggested that idea I did it. I sent Fluff by
      express to a man&mdash;to John Smith&mdash;at Worcester, Mass., and when
      Fluff came back I had to pay $8.55 charges. But I didn't begrudge the
      money. The trip did Fluff a world of good&mdash;it strengthened his voice,
      and made him broader-minded. I tell you,&rdquo; he said enthusiastically,
      &ldquo;there's nothing like travel for broadening the mind! Look at Fluff! Maybe
      he don't show it, but that dog's mind is so broadened by travel that if he
      was turned loose in Alaska he would find his way home. When I found his
      mind was getting so tremendously broad I stopped sending him to places.
      Brownlee&mdash;Brownlee knows all about dogs&mdash;said it would not hurt
      Fluff a bit; he said a dog's mind could not get too broad, and that as far
      as he was concerned he would just like to see once how broad-minded a dog
      could become; he would like to have Fluff sent out by express every time
      he came back. He told me it was an interesting experiment&mdash;that so
      far as he knew it had never been tried before&mdash;and that the thing I
      ought to do was to keep Fluff traveling all the time. He said that so far
      as he knew it was the only way to get rid of Fluff; that some time while
      he was traveling around in the express car there might be a wreck, and we
      would be rid of Fluff; and if there wasn't a wreck, it would be
      interesting to see what effect constant travel would have on a coarse dog.
      He said I might find after a year or two that I had the most cultured dog
      in the United States. Brownlee was willing to have me send Fluff anywhere.
      He suggested a lot of good places to send dogs, but he didn't care enough
      about dog culture to help pay the express charges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Murchison,&rdquo; I said scornfully, &ldquo;I see! You are the kind of a man
      who would let a little money stand between you and getting rid of a dog
      like Fluff! If I had a dog like Fluff, nothing in the world could prevent
      me from getting rid of him. I only wish, he was my dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him!&rdquo; said Murchison generously; &ldquo;I make you a full and free present
      of him. You can have that dog absolutely and wholly. He is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take the dog,&rdquo; I said haughtily, &ldquo;not because I really want a dog,
      nor because I hanker for that particular dog, but because I can see that
      you and Brownlee and Massett have been trifling with him. Bring him over
      in my yard, and I will show you in very short measure how to get rid of
      Fluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon both Brownlee and Massett called on me. They came and sat
      on my porch steps, and Murchison came and sat with them, and all three sat
      and looked at Fluff and talked him over. Every few minutes they would&mdash;Brownlee
      and Massett would&mdash;get up and shake hands with Murchison, and
      congratulate him on having gotten rid of Fluff, and Murchison would blush
      modestly and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is nothing! I always knew I would get rid of him.&rdquo; And there was
      the dog not five feet from them, tied to my lawn hydrant. I watched and
      listened to them until I had had enough of it, and then I went into the
      house and got my shotgun. I loaded it with a good BB shell and went out.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/62.jpg" alt="62" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Fluff saw me first. I never saw a dog exhibit such intelligence as Fluff
      exhibited right then. I suppose travel had broadened him, and probably the
      hydrant was old and rusted out, anyway. When a man moves into a house he
      ought to have <i>all</i> the plumbing attended to the first thing. Any
      ordinary, unbroadened dog would have lain down and pulled, but Fluff
      didn't. First he jumped six feet straight into the air, and that pulled
      the four feet of hydrant pipe up by the roots, and then he went away. He
      took the hydrant and the pipe with him, and that might have surprised me,
      but I saw that he did not know where he was going nor how long he would
      stay there when he reached the place, and a dog can never tell what will
      come handy when he is away from home. A hydrant and a piece of iron pipe
      might be the very thing he would need. So he took them along.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had wanted a fountain in my front yard, I could not have got one half
      as quickly as Fluff furnished that one, and I would never have thought of
      pulling out the hydrant to make me one. Fluff thought of that&mdash;at
      least Brownlee said he thought of it&mdash;but I think all Fluff wanted
      was to get away. And he got away, and the fountain didn't happen to be
      attached to the hydrant, so he left it behind. If it had been attached to
      the hydrant, he would have taken it with him. He was a strong dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Brownlee, when we had heard the pipe rattle across the
      Eighth Street bridge&mdash;&ldquo;there is intelligence for you! You ought to be
      grateful to that dog all your life. <i>You</i> didn't know it was against
      the law to discharge a gun in the city limits, but Fluff did, and he
      wouldn't wait to see you get into trouble. He has heard us talking about
      it, Murchison. I tell you travel has broadened that dog! Look what he has
      saved you,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;by going away at just the psychological
      moment. We should have told you about not firing a gun in the city limits.
      You can't get rid of Fluff that way. It is against the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Massett; &ldquo;and if you knew Fluff as well as we do you would
      know that he is a dog you can't shoot. He is a wonderful dog. He knows all
      about guns. Brownlee tried to make a duck dog out of him, and took him out
      where the ducks were&mdash;showed him the ducks&mdash;shot a gun at the
      ducks&mdash;and what do you think that dog learned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To run,&rdquo; I said, for I had heard about Brownlee teaching Fluff to
      retrieve. Brownlee blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Massett, &ldquo;but that wasn't all. It doesn't take intelligence to
      make a dog run when he sees a gun, but Fluff did not run like an ordinary
      dog. He saw the gun and he saw the ducks, and he saw that Brownlee only
      shot at ducks when they were on the wing. And he thought Brownlee meant to
      shoot him, so what does he do? Stand still? No; he tries to fly. Gets
      right up and tries to fly. He thought that was what Brownlee was trying to
      teach him. He couldn't fly, but he did his best. So whenever Fluff sees a
      gun, he is on the wing, so to speak. You noticed he was on the wing,
      didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him I had noticed it. I said that as far as I could judge, Fluff
      had a good strong wing. I said I didn't mind losing a little thing like a
      hydrant and a length or two of pipe, but I was glad I hadn't fastened
      Fluff to the house&mdash;I always liked my house to have a cellar&mdash;-and
      it would be just like Fluff to stop flying at some place where there
      wasn't any cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Massett, &ldquo;he wouldn't have gone far with the house. A house is
      a great deal heavier than a hydrant. He would probably have moved the
      house off the foundation a little, but, judging by the direction Fluff
      took, the house would have wedged between those two trees, and you would
      have only lost a piece of the porch, or whatever he was tied to. But the
      lesson is that you must not try to shoot Fluff unless you are a good wing
      shot. Unless you can shoot like Davy Crockett, you would be apt to wound
      Fluff without killing him, and then there <i>would</i> be trouble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Murchison, &ldquo;the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals folks. There
      is only one way in which a dog can be killed according to law in this
      place, and that is to have the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals folks do
      it. You send them a letter telling them you have a dog you want killed,
      and asking them to come and kill it. That is according to law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; I said firmly, &ldquo;is what I will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't do any good,&rdquo; said Murchison sadly; &ldquo;they never come. This
      addition to Gallatin is too far from their offices to be handy, and they
      never come. I have eighteen deaths for Fluff on file at their offices
      already, and not one of them has killed him. When you have had as much
      experience with dogs as I have had you will know that the Prevention of
      Cruelty to them in this town does not include killing them when they live
      in the suburbs. The only way a dog can die in the suburbs of Gallatin is
      to die of old age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is Fluff?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fluff is a young dog,&rdquo; said Brownlee. &ldquo;If he had an ordinary dog
      constitution, he would live fifteen years yet, but he hasn't. He has an
      extra strong constitution, and I should say he was good for twenty years
      more. But that isn't what we came over for. We came over to learn how you
      mean to get rid of Fluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brownlee,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I shall think up some way to get rid of Fluff.
      Getting rid of a dog is no task for a mind like mine. But until he returns
      and gives me back my hydrant, I shall do nothing further. I am not going
      to bother about getting rid of a dog that is not here to be got rid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time Fluff returned I had thought out a plan. Murchison had never
      paid the dog tax on Fluff, and that was the same as condemning him to
      death if he was ever caught outside of the yard, but when he was outside
      he could not be caught. He was a hasty mover, and little things such as
      closed gates never prevented him from entering the yard when in haste.
      When he did not jump over he could get right through a fence. But to a man
      of my ability these things are trifles. I knew how to get rid of Fluff. I
      knew how to have him caught in the street without a license. I chained him
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brownlee and Massett and Murchison came and watched me do it. Our street
      is not much used, and the big stake I drove in the street was not much in
      the way of passing grocery delivery wagons. I fastened Fluff to the stake
      with a chain, and then I wrote to the city authorities and complained. I
      said there was a dog without a license that was continually in front of my
      house, and I wished it removed; and a week or so later the dog-catcher
      came around and had a look at Fluff: He walked all around him while
      Massett and Brownlee and Murchison and I leaned over our gates and looked
      on. He was not at all what I should have expected a dog-catcher to be,
      being thin and rather gentlemanly in appearance; and after he had looked
      Fluff over well he came over and spoke to me. He asked me if Fluff was my
      dog. I said he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; said the dog-catcher. &ldquo;And you want to get rid of him. If he was
      my dog, I would want to get rid of him, too. I have seen lots of dogs, but
      I never saw one that was like this, and I do not blame you for wanting to
      part with him. I have had my eye on him for several years, but this is the
      first opportunity I have had to approach him. Now, however, he seems to
      have broken all the dog laws. He has not secured a license, and he is in
      the public highway. It will be my duty to take him up and gently
      chloroform him as soon as I make sure of one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what it is,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I will help you make sure of ft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I will attend to it,&rdquo; and with that he got on
      his wagon and drove off. He returned in about an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not because my legal duty compels me, but because
      I knew you would be anxious. If I owned a dog like that, I would be
      anxious, too. I can't take that dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; we all asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been down to the city hall, and I have looked
      up the records, and I find that the streets of this addition to the city
      have not been accepted by the city. The titles to the property are so made
      out that until the city legally accepts the streets, each property owner
      owns to the middle of the street fronting his property. If you will step
      out and look, you will see that the dog is on your own property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/72.jpg" alt="72" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will move the stake. I will put him on the
      other side of the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would like him any better there,&rdquo; said the dog-catcher, &ldquo;you can
      move him, but it would make no difference to me. Then he would be on the
      private property of the man who owns the property across the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my good man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how <i>is</i> a man to get rid of a dog he
      does not want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog-catcher frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;seems to be one of the things our lawmakers have not
      thought of. But whatever you do, I advise you to be careful. Do not try
      any underhand methods, for now that my attention has been called to the
      dog, I shall have to watch his future and see that he is not badly used. I
      am an officer of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals as well as a
      dog-catcher, and I warn you to be careful what you do with that dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he got on his wagon again and drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I was a nervous wreck, for Fluff had howled all night,
      and Murchison came over soon after breakfast. He was accompanied by
      Brownlee and Massett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I am the last man in the world to do anything that my neighbors
      would take offense at,&rdquo; he said, as soon as they were seated on my porch,
      &ldquo;and Brownlee and Massett love dogs as few men ever love them; but
      something has to be done about Fluff. The time has come when we must sleep
      with our windows open, and neither Massett nor Brownlee nor I got a minute
      of sleep last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is different entirely,&rdquo; said Murchison. &ldquo;Fluff is your dog, and if
      you want to keep a howling dog, you would be inclined to put up with the
      howl, but we have no interest in the dog at all. We do not own him, and we
      consider him a nuisance. We have decided to ask you to get rid of him. It
      is unjust to your neighbors to keep a howling dog. You will have to get
      rid of Fluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Massett. &ldquo;For ten nights I have not slept a wink, and
      neither has Murchison, nor has Brownlee&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Massett. &ldquo;And four men going without sleep for ten nights
      is equal to one man going without sleep forty nights, which would kill any
      man. Practically, Fluff has killed a man, and is a murderer, and as you
      are responsible for him, it is the same as if you were a murderer
      yourself; and as you were one of the four who did not sleep, you may also
      be said to have committed suicide. But we do not mean to give you into the
      hands of the law until we have remonstrated with you. But we feel deeply,
      and the more so because you could easily give us some nights of sleep in
      which to recuperate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can tell me how,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will gladly do it. I need sleep more
      at this minute than I ever needed it in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Massett; &ldquo;just get out your shotgun and show it to
      Fluff. When he sees the gun he will run. He will take wings like a duck,
      and while he is away we can get a few nights' rest. That will be
      something. And if we are not in good condition by that time, you can show
      him the shotgun again. Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he grew enthusiastic over
      his idea, &ldquo;you can keep Fluff eternally on the wing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt that I needed a vacation from Fluff. I unchained him and went in to
      get my shotgun. Then I showed him the shotgun, and we had two good nights
      of sleep. After that, whenever we felt that we needed a few nights in
      peace, I just showed Fluff the shotgun and he went away on one of his
      flying trips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Brownlee&mdash;Brownlee knew all about dogs&mdash;who first
      called my attention to what he called the periodicity of Fluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you would never have noticed it,&rdquo; he said one day when Murchison and
      I were sitting on my porch with him, &ldquo;but I did. That is because I have
      studied dogs. I know all about dogs, and I know Fluff can run. This is
      because he has greyhound blood in him. With a little wolf. That is why I
      studied Fluff, and how I came to notice that every time you show him the
      shotgun he is gone just forty-eight hours. Now, you go and get your
      shotgun and try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I tried it, and Fluff went away as he always did; and Brownlee sat
      there bragging about how Fluff could run, and about how wonderful he was
      himself to have thought of the periodicity of Fluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see how he went?&rdquo; he asked enthusiastically. &ldquo;That gait was a
      thirty-mile-an-hour gait. Why, that dog travels&mdash;he travels&mdash;&rdquo;
       He took out a piece of paper and a pencil and figured it out. &ldquo;In
      forty-eight hours he travels fourteen hundred and forty miles! He gets
      seven hundred and twenty miles from home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't seem possible,&rdquo; said Murchison. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Brownlee frankly,
      &ldquo;it doesn't.&rdquo; He went over his figures again. &ldquo;But that is figured
      correctly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If&mdash;but maybe I did not gauge his speed
      correctly. And I didn't allow for stopping to turn around at the end of
      the out sprint. What we ought to have on that dog is a pedometer. If I
      owned a dog like that, the first thing I would get would be a pedometer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told Brownlee that if he wished I would give him Fluff, and he could put
      a pedometer, or anything else, on him; but Brownlee remembered he had some
      work to do and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was right about the periodicity of Fluff. Almost on the minute at
      the end of forty-eight hours Fluff returned, and Brownlee and Murchison,
      who were there to receive him, were as pleased as if Fluff had been going
      away instead of returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dog,&rdquo; said Brownlee, &ldquo;is a wonderful animal. If Sir Isaac Newton had
      that dog, he would have proved something or other of universal value by
      him. That dog is plumb full of ratios and things, if we only knew how to
      get them out of him. I bet if Sir Isaac Newton had had Fluff as long as
      you have had him he would have had a formula all worked out&mdash;x/y(2xz-dog)=2(4ab-3x)
      or something of that kind, so that anyone with half a knowledge of algebra
      could figure out the square root of any dog any time of the day or night.
      I could get up a Law of Dog myself if I had the time, with a dog like
      Fluff to work on. 'If one dog travels fourteen hundred and forty miles at
      the sight of a gun, how far would two dogs travel?' All that sort of
      thing. Stop!&rdquo; he ejaculated suddenly. &ldquo;If one dog travels forty-eight
      hours at the sight of one gun, how far would he travel at the sight of two
      guns? Murchison,&rdquo; he cried enthusiastically, &ldquo;I've got it! I've got the
      fundamental law of periodicity in dogs! Go get your gun,&rdquo; he said to me,
      &ldquo;and I will get mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/82.jpg" alt="82" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      He stopped at the gate long enough to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Murchison, we are on the verge of a mighty important
      discovery&mdash;a mighty important discovery! If this thing turns out
      right, we will be at the root of all dog nature. We will have the great
      underlying law of scared dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came back with his shotgun carefully hidden behind him, and then he and
      I showed Fluff the two guns simultaneously. For one minute Fluff was
      startled. Then he vanished. All we saw of him as he went was the dust he
      left in his wake. Massett had come over when Brownlee brought over his
      gun, and Murchison and I sat and smoked while Massett and Brownlee fought
      out the periodicity of Fluff. Brownlee said that for two guns Fluff would
      traverse the same distance as for one, but twice as quickly; but Massett
      said Brownlee was foolish, and that anyone who knew anything about dogs
      would know that no dog could go faster than Fluff had gone at the sight of
      one gun. Massett said Fluff would travel at his regular one-gun speed, but
      would travel a two-gun distance. He said Fluff would not be back for
      ninety-six hours. Brownlee said he would be back in forty-eight hours, but
      both agreed that he would travel twenty-eight hundred and eighty miles.
      Then Murchison went home and got a map, and showed Brownlee and Massett
      that if Fluff traveled fourteen hundred miles in the direction he had
      started he would have to do the last two hundred miles as a swim, because
      he would strike the Atlantic Ocean at the twelve hundredth mile. But
      Brownlee just turned up his nose and sneered. He said Fluff was no fool,
      and that when he reached the coast he would veer to the north and travel
      along the beach for two hundred miles or so. Then Massett said that he had
      been thinking about Brownlee's theory, and he <i>knew</i> no dog could do
      what Brownlee said Fluff would do&mdash;sixty miles an hour. He said he
      agreed that a dog like Fluff could do thirty miles an hour if he did not
      stop to howl, because his howl represented about sixty horse power, but
      that no dog could ever do sixty miles an hour. Then Brownlee got mad and
      said Massett was a born idiot, and that Fluff not only <i>could</i> do
      sixty miles, but he could keep on increasing his speed at the rate of
      thirty miles per gun indefinitely. Then they went home mad, but they
      agreed to be on hand when Fluff returned. But they were not. Fluff came
      home in twenty-four hours, almost to the minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went over and told Brownlee, he wouldn't believe it at first, but
      when I showed him Fluff, he cheered up and clapped me on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;we have made a great discovery. We have
      discovered the law of scared dogs. 'A dog is scared in inverse ratio to
      the number of guns!' Now, it wouldn't be fair to try Fluff again without
      giving him a breathing spell, but to-morrow I will come over, and we will
      try him with four guns. We will work this thing out thoroughly,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;before we write to the Academy of Science, or whatever a person would
      write to, so that there will be no mistake. Before we give this secret to
      the world we want to have it complete. We will try Fluff with any number
      of guns, and with pistols and rifles, and if we can get one we will try
      him with a cannon. We will keep at it for years and years. You and I will
      be famous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told Brownlee that if he wanted to experiment for years with Fluff he
      could have him, but that all I wanted was to get rid of him; but Brownlee
      wouldn't hear of that. He said he would buy Fluff of me if he was rich
      enough, but that Fluff was so valuable he couldn't think of buying him. He
      would let me keep him. He said he would be over the next day to try Fluff
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the next day he and Murchison and Massett came over and held a
      consultation on my porch to decide how many guns they would try on Fluff.
      They could not agree. Massett wanted to try four guns and have Fluff
      absent only half a day, but Brownlee wanted to have me break my shotgun in
      two and try that on Fluff. He said that according to the law of scared
      dogs, a half a gun, working it out by inverse ratio, would keep Fluff away
      for twice as long as one gun, which would be ninety-six hours; and while
      they were arguing it out Fluff came around the house unsuspectingly and
      saw us on the porch. He gave us one startled glance and started north by
      northeast at what Brownlee said was the most marvelous rate of speed he
      ever saw. Then he and Massett got down off the porch and looked for guns,
      but there were none in sight. There wasn't anything that looked the least
      like a gun. Not even a broomstick. Brownlee said he knew what was the
      matter&mdash;Fluff was having a little practice run to keep in good
      condition, and would be back in a few hours; but, judging by the look he
      gave us as he went, I thought he would be gone longer than that.
    </p>

      I could see that Brownlee was worried, and as day followed day without any
      return of Fluff, Murchison and I tried to cheer him up, showing him how
      much better we all slept while Fluff was away; but it did not cheer up
      poor Brownlee. He had set his faith on that dog, and the dog had deceived
      him. We all became anxious about Brownlee's health&mdash;he moped around
      so; and just when we began to be afraid he was going into a decline he
      cheered up, and came over as bright and happy as a man could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; he exclaimed joyfully, as soon as he was inside my gate.
      &ldquo;And it makes me ashamed of myself that I didn't think of it the moment I
      saw Fluff start off. You will never see that dog again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told Brownlee that that was good news, anyway, even if it did upset his
      law of scared dogs; but he smiled a superior smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disprove nothing!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It proves my law. Didn't I say in the first
      place that the time a dog would be gone was in inverse ratio to the number
      of guns? Well, the inverse ratio to no guns is infinite time&mdash;that is
      how long Fluff will be gone; that is how long he will run. Why, that dog
      will never stop running while there is any dog left in him. He can't help
      it&mdash;it is the law of scared dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;that that dog will run on and on
      forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Brownlee proudly. &ldquo;As long as there is a particle of him
      left he will keep on running. That is the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maybe Brownlee was right. I don't know. But what I would like to know is
      the name of some one who would like a dog that looks like Fluff, and is
      his size, and that howls like him and that answers to his name. A dog of
      that kind returned to Murchison's house a long time before infinity, and I
      would like to get rid of him. Brownlee says it isn't Fluff; that his law
      couldn't be wrong, and that this is merely a dog that resembles Fluff.
      Maybe Brownlee is right, but I would like to know some one that wants a
      dog with a richly melodious voice.
